# CI/CD Pipeline for Docker Image Build and Deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)


## Installing Docker:
Ensures that the pipeline has the necessary tools to build Docker images.

## Building and pushing the Docker image:
Ensures that applicationâ€™s containerized version is created and securely stored in a cloud registry (ACR), where it can be accessed later.

## Deploying to AKS:
Ensures that the built Docker image is deployed to a production-ready environment (AKS), enabling application to run in the cloud on a highly scalable, managed Kubernetes service.
